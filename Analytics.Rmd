# Why its **R**ight

Alright, a little humility goes a long way, so I should start by saying **R** isn't always right. In fact it can be catestrophically wrong. I've touched on it in another post (add post) but R is a tool. Tools are a reflection of their users. Give a chainsaw to a lumberjack and you can get an authentic rustic log cabin getaway to be the envy of all your corporate peers. Give me a chainsaw and you'll probably get an emergency room visit. Additionally, tools rarely shine outside the area they're built for! It may seem like hyperbole, but there are more than a few in corporate America who - when a salesmen sells them a chainsaw as a cutting edge technological innovation that will make the company lumberlytical - will understand only that the tool is meant for cutting things. Birthday parties were never the same at that corporation...

Tool context matters. **R** is really good for some things and not for others. Additionally, staff need to be able to grow into the tool. **R** is powerful, but its also pretty abstract - which means there's a learning curve. You can't put any modern day process or technology in front of a caveman and expect them to just magically figure it out, unless that process is car insurance I guess. Even then, they're still probably wondering what the #*&! a car is...

So when is **R** right you might be asking. Well if you've read any of my blogs so far you should know that its usually about the third paragraph of a section that I say anything useful (if at all). From my experience, **R** has been core to analytics and reporting. I have not seen a tool that provide better frameworks for general data science and is so easily connected to the tools used for presenting and reporting. This makes it particualarly to those who deal with crowds not comfortable with data, science, and the people that enjoy data and science (i.e. business boys/girls).

## My experience with R

As far as I can tell, much of what makes __R__ valuable is not even aspects native to the language, but rather the community. Additionally, I believe the community has developed the most appropriate philosophical framework for analytics. That's a big statement, and also vague enough that the critic in me recognizes it as meaningless so I'll try and expand. Quick Note: It goes without saying that everything here is heavily reliant on my personal experiences - biased by what I know- and more troublingly biased by what I don't know. If I speak ignorantly, I would greatly appreciate a reader reaching out and educating me. Alright, enough of that humility.

I believe __R__ has the best community, which has as a collective built tools that most appropriately facilitate analytics. This is not to say that there are not more efficient languages. In fact, many other languages - like python - are more than able to solve analytical problems. However, I have not been swayed that the solutions of these products lead to best practices or come without trade-offs. R, and the most popular IDE Rstudio, along with the overall community have intentionally built the tools to facilitate cutting edge analytics with respect to more than just the computational aspect of analytics. R was build as an alternative to SAS. In my opinion the community of R users is more heavily tilted towards the statistician rather than the computer programmer and acadamia vs industry. This leads to R prioritizing the needs and objectives of the statistician/researcher over the programmer/business analyst. These differences are how I explain the strong connection between R and tools like the tydverse, Rmarkdown, and the analytics driven culture. Other languages appear to implement selectively __R__ ideas, but fundamentally, these languages serve other masters - programmers or business analysts. General languages like python are able to bring more people into an analytics fold, but at a cost of the ideal (this trade-off is worth the price on a case by case. My point is there is a non negligible number of projects where such a trade-off is not worthwhile). This culminates in a difference between the __R__ community and other language/tool communities. Although their is great overlap between __R__ and other communities, their are noteable differences at the extreme. My conjecture is that these extremes are most likely to drive innovation and pull a distribution dispropotionately. __R__ has a drastically stronger pull towards research and statistics, leading it to be a better language for reproducibility and research. Sidenote, this is probably pretty late to make this distinguishment, but by reproducible I don't necessarily mean the environment on which code is run. __R__ comes from acadamia's need for statistical computation, which differs from what is generally provided by more universal languages. This is all to say computer languages tend to have niches they're good at, and __R__ seems to have its. Julia may overtake it with time, but I suspect there will be more merger than removal. The following graph just demonstrates my belief that the average R programmer leans more into reproducible analytical research than other programming communities. This shift in the distribution has a meaningful change, particularly as you move further to the right. (Make article on the garbage viewpoints on distribution differences.)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)


Graph_data <- data.frame("R Communities" = rnorm(1000,1,1),"Other Communities" = rnorm(1000,0,1),check.names = F) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 1:2, names_to = "Community", values_to = "Data")

Graph_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Data`) ) +
  geom_density(aes(fill=`Community`), alpha=0.8) +
  xlab("Community Interest in Reproducibility/Research") +
  ylab("") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(-2,4), labels=c("Low Priority", "High Priority")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  ggtitle(label =  "Unnecessary Visual Graph")
```

Base R is pretty cool, but the community developed packages are what gives __R__ power. Specifically, the tidyverse is probably where beginners should start. There's no better explanation for the tidyverse than the video below:

Alright, so now that you've watched this video I'll elaborate on why any serious data scientist will unquestionably use their celebrity hall pass on Hadley Wickham. Honestly, that should be the starting interview question for all data scientist positions, and if they answer with Scarlett Johansson or Ryan Reynolds I can tell you definitively they've never seen a corporate data set and have no idea what they're doing (Note: Ryan Renolds is technically not a right answer, but it is admittedly more understandable than others).

# Tips and Tricks

I have circled around frameworks on this blog, so lets begin with one I found particularly useful is vertical. I won't spend time discussing this, as the website lays it out very nicely.

## Graphs

People have an unhealthy obsession with with graphs in excel. Additionally, I'm not really a fan of more interactive graphs like those in PowerBI. Don't get me wrong, I don't have great justification for this dislike other than I find many interactive graphs allow users to play around with the data. There's a place for this, but it can also drown business users in data as well as inhibit users from being specific about __what they want to see and why__. I'm not trying to harp on exploration, but if every "*it'd be nice to have*" graph in business was made we'd all agree to stop making graphs. At least we'd stop over hyping visualization in the analytics industry. Maybe that's not a bad thing.

As for meaningful content, I would start by noting that the ggplot package is a primary go-to for all static visual needs. I will try to add some content on how you can get the most out of ggplot2, but for now I'll just give a quick and dirty option for those not familiar with the ggplot2 semantics. Drag and drop has its place, so if you want to use ggplot2 but you're not an R expert, I would use esquisse. Google it and you can learn all you need to know.

## HTML/CSS

I don't have much to say about html other than its a better word document. Most business analysts are comfortable with word, largely because they can edit it . However, word is an absolute nightmare. It really hard to have consistent formatting in word... both across documents and even within. Additionally, you inevitably end up with 15 documents following the format of report.docx, report 1.docx, report 2.docx, report final 2.docx, report real final.docx. Html with markdown allow you to version control your reports and apply consistent formatting easily because it separates the two concepts.

I believe this concept will continue to catch on in strong analytic/business departments. Interested readers can learn more about how css and html can be used in corporate reporting [here](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2017/09/09/rmarkdown)

## Websites

Once you start working on a large project, you'll realize you have a lot of content. There will be PowerPoints for the executives to not understand, excel files for the business analyst to morph into a 60 tab workbook that crashes on opening, and R scripts that - if they run without errors - make the data scientist curse your coding... also, it'll turn out that the data scientist in this story is also you, so serves you right for $&*% code. 

Unfortunately, almost nothing mentioned above can be made better in a website, but it does allow you to create a intuitive layout for others to explore your masterpiece/monsterpiece. I have yet to come across a better way to layer various files in a single, maintainable location that most importantly, can be navigated by those that have no understanding of the project. This is important, because these are likely the individuals responsible for the project. I'm not even kidding, we as humans spend probably 75% of the day on our computers. Its our modern day cave walls. Executives and managers don't have the time to explore or understand the intricacies of a project, but they're expected to point regulators and board members where in the cave they can find the [random question only god knows how they aquired.](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=magic+8+ball&crid=191Z6U0OXH5W5&sprefix=magic+8%2Caps%2C198&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-a-p_1_7)
