# The Majors of Me

## I Was Put Under New Management

Probably not the way my wife would like me to phrase our marriage, but she is terribly bored by anything I do involving code, math, or conversation not pertaining to 90-day british bakeoff or whatever MTV reality TV show she's watching. Admittedly, we have rather different hobbies, but the last year of marriage has been amazing. She makes me a better person, and that makes me a better coder and mathematician. She has also made me realize how much cleaner an apartment can be when you put your clothes in a hamper rather than the floor... In anycase, we have been blessed by an amazing first year of marriage, and I look forward to the future!
