In fact it can be catestrophically wrong. I’ve touched on it in another post (add post) but R is a tool. Tools are a reflection of their users. Give a chainsaw to a lumberjack and you can get an authentic rustic log cabin getaway to be the envy of all your corporate peers. Give me a chainsaw and you’ll probably get an emergency room visit. Additionally, tools rarely shine outside the area they’re built for! It may seem like hyperbole, but there are more than a few in corporate America who - when a salesmen sells them a chainsaw as a cutting edge technological innovation that will make the company lumberlytical - will understand only that the tool is meant for cutting things. Birthday parties were never the same at that corporation…\r\n\r\nTool context matters. R is really good for some things and not for others. Additionally, staff need to be able to grow into the tool. R is powerful, but its also pretty abstract - which means there’s a learning curve. You can’t put any modern day process or technology in front of a caveman and expect them to just magically figure it out, unless that process is car insurance I guess. Even then, they’re still probably wondering what the #*&! a car is…\r\nGeico: Not a paid sponsor of this blogSo when is R right you might be asking. Well if you’ve read any of my blogs so far you should know that its usually about the third paragraph of a section that I say anything useful (if at all). From my experience, R has been core to analytics and reporting. I have not seen a tool that provide better frameworks for general data science and is so easily connected to the tools used for presenting and reporting. This makes it particualarly to those who deal with crowds not comfortable with data, science, and the people that enjoy data and science (i.e. business boys/girls).\r\nMy experience with R\r\nAs far as I can tell, much of what makes R valuable is not even aspects native to the language, but rather the community. Additionally, I believe the community has developed the most appropriate philosophical framework for analytics. That’s a big statement, and also vague enough that the critic in me recognizes it as meaningless so I’ll try and expand. Quick Note: It goes without saying that everything here is heavily reliant on my personal experiences - biased by what I know- and more troublingly biased by what I don’t know. If I speak ignorantly, I would greatly appreciate a reader reaching out and educating me. Alright, enough of that humility.\r\nI believe R has the best community, which has as a collective built tools that most appropriately facilitate analytics. This is not to say that there are not more efficient languages. In fact, many other languages - like python - are more than able to solve analytical problems. However, I have not been swayed that the solutions of these products lead to best practices or come without trade-offs. R, and the most popular IDE Rstudio, along with the overall community have intentionally built the tools to facilitate cutting edge analytics with respect to more than just the computational aspect of analytics.\r\nR was build as an alternative to SAS. In my opinion the community of R users is more heavily tilted towards the statistician rather than the computer programmer and acadamia vs industry. This leads to R prioritizing the needs and objectives of the statistician/researcher over the programmer/business analyst. These differences are how I explain the strong connection between R and tools like the tydverse, Rmarkdown, and the analytics driven culture. Other languages appear to implement selectively R ideas, but fundamentally, these languages serve other masters - programmers or business analysts. General languages like python are able to bring more people into an analytics fold, but at a cost of the ideal (this trade-off is worth the price on a case by case. My point is there is a non negligible number of projects where such a trade-off is not worthwhile).\r\nThis culminates in a difference between the R community and other language/tool communities. Although their is great overlap between R and other communities, their are noteable differences at the extreme. My conjecture is that these extremes are most likely to drive innovation and pull a distribution dispropotionately. R has a drastically stronger pull towards research and statistics, leading it to be a better language for reproducibility and research. Sidenote, this is probably pretty late to make this distinguishment, but by reproducible I don’t necessarily mean the environment on which code is run. R comes from acadamia’s need for statistical computation, which differs from what is generally provided by more universal languages. This is all to say computer languages tend to have niches they’re good at, and R seems to have its. Julia may overtake it with time, but I suspect there will be more merger than removal. The following graph just demonstrates my belief that the average R programmer leans more into reproducible analytical research than other programming communities. This shift in the distribution has a meaningful change, particularly as you move further to the right. (Make article on the garbage viewpoints on distribution differences.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBase R is pretty cool, but the community developed packages are what gives R power. Specifically, the tidyverse is probably where beginners should start. There’s no better explanation for the tidyverse than the video below:\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright, so now that you’ve watched this video I’ll elaborate on why any serious data scientist will unquestionably use their celebrity hall pass on Hadley Wickham. Honestly, that should be the starting interview question for all data scientist positions, and if they answer with Scarlett Johansson or Ryan Reynolds I can tell you definitively they’ve never seen a corporate data set and have no idea what they’re doing (Note: Ryan Renolds is technically not a right answer, but it is admittedly more understandable than others).\r\nTips and Tricks\r\nI have circled around frameworks on this blog, so lets begin with one I found particularly useful is vertical. I won’t spend time discussing this, as the website lays it out very nicely. Vertical Website\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraphs\r\nPeople have an unhealthy obsession with with graphs in excel. Additionally, I’m not really a fan of more interactive graphs like those in PowerBI. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have great justification for this dislike other than I find many interactive graphs allow users to play around with the data. There’s a place for this, but it can also drown business users in data as well as inhibit users from being specific about what they want to see and why. I’m not trying to harp on exploration, but if every “it’d be nice to have” graph in business was made we’d all agree to stop making graphs. At least we’d stop over hyping visualization in the analytics industry. Maybe that’s not a bad thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Imgflip Meme Generator\r\n\r\nAs for meaningful content, I would start by noting that the ggplot package is a primary go-to for all static visual needs. I will try to add some content on how you can get the most out of ggplot2, but for now I’ll just give a quick and dirty option for those not familiar with the ggplot2 semantics. Drag and drop has its place, so if you want to use ggplot2 but you’re not an R expert, I would use esquisse. Google it and you can learn all you need to know.\r\nHTML/CSS\r\nI don’t have much to say about html other than its a better word document. Most business analysts are comfortable with word, largely because they can edit it . However, word is an absolute nightmare. Its really hard to have consistent formatting in word… both across documents and even within. Additionally, you inevitably end up with 15 documents following the format of report.docx, report 1.docx, report 2.docx, report final 2.docx, report real final.docx. Html with markdown allow you to version control your reports and apply consistent formatting easily because it separates the two concepts.\r\nI believe this concept will continue to catch on in strong analytic/business departments. Interested readers can learn more about how css and html can be used in corporate reporting here\r\nWebsites\r\nOnce you start working on a large project, you’ll realize you have a lot of content. There will be PowerPoints for the executives to not understand, excel files for the business analyst to morph into a 60 tab workbook that crashes on opening, and R scripts that - if they run without errors - make the data scientist curse your coding… also, it’ll turn out that the data scientist in this story is also you, so serves you right for $&*% code.\r\nUnfortunately, almost nothing mentioned above can be made better in a website, but it does allow you to create a intuitive layout for others to explore your masterpiece/monsterpiece. I have yet to come across a better way to layer various files in a single, maintainable location that most importantly, can be navigated by those that have no understanding of the project. This is important, because these are likely the individuals responsible for the project. I’m not even kidding, we as humans spend probably 75% of the day on our computers. Its our modern day cave walls. Executives and managers don’t have the time to explore or understand the intricacies of a project, but they’re expected to point regulators and board members where in the corporate cave they can find the random question only god knows how they aquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

People seem to argue the definition of data scientist with the same contention that they swear by apple or android. I beleive Josh Willis has one of the better definitions with:\r\n\r\nData Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.\r\n\r\nOne academic institution I came across described the role as:\r\n\r\nan analytical expert who utilizes their skills in both technology and social science to find trends and manage data. They use industry knowledge, contextual understanding, skepticism of existing assumptions – to uncover solutions to business challenges.\r\n\r\nWith so many opinions out there, you’d have to be mad to add your own…. So, my definition of a data scientist would be:\r\n\r\nA problem solver with knowledge of math, software, coding, data and abstraction.\r\n\r\nSolving Problems is More Important Than Design Design is More Important Than Coding Coding is More Important than the Language & Frameworks\r\nI Was Put Under New Management\r\nProbably not the way my wife would like me to phrase our marriage, but she is terribly bored by anything I do involving code, math, or conversation not pertaining to 90-day british bakeoff or whatever MTV reality TV show she’s watching. Admittedly, we have rather different hobbies, but the last year of marriage has been amazing. She makes me a better person, and that makes me a better coder and mathematician. She has also made me realize how much cleaner an apartment can be when you put your clothes in a hamper rather than the floor… In anycase, we have been blessed by an amazing first year of marriage, and I look forward to the future!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe Got a Cat!\r\nAs of the first week of 2021, I have seriously contemplated transitioning this website to something more useful and relatable to the general public - a repository of cat pictures. You may be thinking, but the internet is already 80% cat pictures and 20% human debauchery, do we really need more cats.\r\nI could craft a convincing arguement, but as Fred Barnard said, a picture’s worth a thousand words.\r\n\r\nWhat? No rebuttle? Cat got your tongue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Again, a misleading headline has you thinking you’re gonna get some pie tips. But if you want those, turn on your basic british bakeoff reality tv show or whatever it is my wife watches, your not getting it here. Sorry Hugh Neutron, but this is the exact opposite of that. I’m here to dash your graph in the sky dreams. But don’t lose all hope, even if the dessert table is closed, the bar is open late (this will make sense later).\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Imgflip Meme Generator\r\n\r\nBacking up my facts\r\nI wish I was the first to critisize the pie chart. It might have made me unique. I can only imagine how much time I could have spent looking down on peers who could not understand the conceptual inadequacies of a pie chart. Unfortunately, I did not think of this myself, but rather came accross an article a while and was like “ohhh, yeah… that makes sense. Pie charts suck.” Now that I have admitted that I am merely a messenger of the analytic gods, I can list those that came before. This will hopefully convince you that the messege is worth noting, even if the messenger is more renown for his memes than his insights.\r\nWith that in mind the following are several articles meant to persuade/bore you into banishing the pie chart from your corporate reporting: 1) Save the Pies for Dessert by Stephen Few 2) People, Please Stop Using Pie Charts by Bernard Marr\r\nNow some might suspect Bernard Marr as being biased, as his name is literally an anogram for Dear Bar Graph if you merely substitute two r’s an n and an m for the letters that spell graph, but I encourage you to look deeper. The ultimate flaw of the pie graph is the same one that drove every high school crush to reject my prom invitation… ultimately, theres something better.\r\nSo whats the Alternative?\r\nI’ll make this brief, because at this point you’re probably getting bored. Basically, pie charts don’t allow you to easily compare components and can distort analysis as people are generally better at processing information in lines rather than angles. Bar graphs can accomplish the same task as a a pie graph, but allow easy comparison of all components within the graph. The video below provides a humorous end to this blog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
