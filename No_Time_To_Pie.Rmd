# "Notes on how to make a better pie chart"

Ha! Again, a misleading headline has you thinking you're gonna get some pie tips. But if you want those, turn on your basic british bakeoff reality tv show or whatever it is my wife watches, your not getting it here. Sorry [Hugh Neutron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoKdcS5GJY), but this is the exact opposite of that. I'm here to dash your graph in the sky dreams. But don't lose all hope, even if the dessert table is closed, the bar is open late (this will make sense later).

# Backing up my facts

I wish I was the first to critisize the pie chart. It might have made me unique. I can only imagine how much time I could have spent looking down on peers who could not understand the conceptual inadequacies of a pie chart. Unfortunately, I did not think of this myself, but rather came accross an article a while and was like "ohhh, yeah... that makes sense. Pie charts suck." Now that I have admitted that I am merely a messenger of the analytic gods, I can list those that came before. This will hopefully convince you that the messege is worth noting, even if the messenger is more renown for his memes than his insights. 

With that in mind the following are several articles meant to persuade/bore you into banishing the pie chart from your corporate reporting:
1) [Save the Pies for Dessert by Stephen Few](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/save_the_pies_for_dessert.pdf?_ga=2.149186422.1704921408.1606954722-729238164.1606954722)
2) [People, Please Stop Using Pie Charts by Bernard Marr](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/239932?_ga=2.150840310.1704921408.1606954722-729238164.1606954722)

Now some might suspect Bernard Marr as being biased, as his name is literally an anogram for dear bar graph if you substitute rnMr
